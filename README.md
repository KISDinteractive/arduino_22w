# Interactive Systems [Application] â€“  Winter 22/23
# Arduino and Prototyping

***Disclaimer:*** *This repo documents an Interaction Design course held at [KISD](https://kisd.de) in the winter term 2022/23. In the "sessions" section you can find supporting material to the four sessions for consolidation or rework in case of missed meetings. Please keep in mind that the transcript was not written for (scientific) completeness _and that reading without participation_ in the course is of limited value.*
